## Description

### Aim

> To develop a Online Tutoring Platform that aims to provide a service connect students with teachers, matching them together accordingly and providing a channel for interaction.Choices.

### Motivation

The Malawian educational system has failed to fully cater for both teachers, where a large number of remained unemployed or with low pay, and students, who may find it difficult to have their individual needs taken care of due to larger classes usually caused by lack of teachers thus creating a classroom environment that forces teachers to focus less on the individual especially ones in need of help.This has caused many to seek tutoring as a means of extra income on the part of the teacher and a more personalised form of learning enhancing academic performance on behalf of the student. Current methods of locating a tutor prove difficult due to the effort needed to research and network on the users end, and existing online platforms in regards to our country fail to provide feedback on the quality and type of service they’re getting.

### Key features

- To connect students easily with experts from all over the country according to their needs.
- It should provide various methods of interaction including video, audio, or text.
- The platform should allow instructors to provide material in many multimedia formats in an organised and structured way to consume it.
- Students and the instructors should be able to rate each other to dictate how and who their future interactions with other users plays out, similar to Uber's “gig economy model”.

### 1. Engine Lock

Locking the node engine and the type of package manager for consistency

#### Minimum Version

Node v14

#### Package Manager

npm

### 2. Specific Lint Rules

A linter is a tool that checks source code for potential errors and coding style issues. It analyzes the code for syntax errors, logical errors, and formatting errors, and reports them back to the developer. The primary goal of a linter is to help developers identify and fix potential bugs or problems in their code before it is executed.

- Automatic react imports on every file that declares it
- Unused variables have been set to **warning**

### 3. Prettier Rules

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

- Trailing commas = **es5** style
- tabwidth = 2
- semi
- single quotes

---

### 4. Git Hooks

It is a script that runs at different stages of the git process. This is to enforce code quality standards to everyone on the team for everyone to commit or push to git

- Run linter after every commit to test partial code improvements
- Run build command to check if site is still operational after every push to the repo
- Check that every commit message is up to standard, this stadard can be seen in the **commitlint.config.js** file in the comments
